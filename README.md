# Choose Your Professor 🎓

**Choose Your Professor** is an early-stage passion project inspired by real stories and struggles I’ve seen as a student advisor at my community college. The idea is simple but important: give students an easier, ad-free, and honest way to choose professors and counselors based on feedback from their peers.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Over the last year, I’ve spoken to countless students who were misadvised into taking classes they didn’t need—some of which delayed their transfers or wasted their time and money. The common thread? Poor communication, lack of accessible reviews, and no centralized place to vet professors or counselors before committing.

This website aims to change that.

## 🌐 What It Does (So Far)

The current version is a static front-end demo built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features:

- A clean, modern UI inspired by [Acquisition.com](https://www.acquisition.com/)
- A purple background with yellow text for a bold visual experience
- A homepage with two buttons:
  - **Choose Your Professor**
  - **Choose Your Counselor**
- A prompt to enter your college name after selecting an option

## 🚧 What's Next?

This project is only **about 1% complete**, but here's what I plan to add as I learn more:

- A database to collect student reviews
- AI-powered summaries of multiple reviews per professor/counselor
- A simple and intuitive search/filter system
- A respectful, student-first platform that gives direct information with **no ads**, **no fluff**

## 🔍 Long-Term Vision

I want this platform to be a free and reliable resource for students who are just trying to survive college. The goal is not just to rate, but to **guide**—to help students make better decisions from day one and avoid the same mistakes others made.

## 📚 Tech Stack (Current)

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

No backend or database implemented yet—this is just the beginning!
